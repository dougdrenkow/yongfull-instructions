###

1 PREREQUISITES

1.1 npm Modules

https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

Download Windows Installer (.msi) 64-bit for Current (Latest Features): v7.4.0 (includes npm 4.0.5).
 
Make sure to include Path in installation, so can run node and npm from CMD (as Administrator).


1.2 MongoDB
 
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/


1.2.1 Download and Install Mongo DB "Community Server" (Free) Edition on Windows
 
https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community
 
Current Stable Release (3.4.1)
 
Version: Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit and later, with SSL support x64
 
mongodb-win32-x....msi
 
"If you are running any edition of Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7, please install a hotfix to resolve an issue with memory mapped files on Windows."
 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2731284/-33-dos-error-code-when-memory-memory-mapped-files-are-cleaned-by-using-the-flushviewoffile-function-in-windows-7-or-in-windows-server-2008-r2
 
"These instructions assume that you have installed MongoDB to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\." 


1.2.2 Run MongoDB Community Edition
 
"WARNING: Do not make mongod.exe visible on public networks without running in 'Secure Mode' with the auth setting. MongoDB is designed to be run in trusted environments, and the database does not enable 'Secure Mode' by default."
 
Set up the MongoDB environment.
 
Make a data directory, to store all data, with the default path:
 
> md \data\db
 
OR specify an alternate path (wrap the path in double-quotes if it includes any spaces) (and, of course, md the directory first):
 
> "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\mongodb\data4"

Ctrl-C to stop. 

To start MongoDB:
 
> "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"
 
"The 'waiting for connections message' in the console output indicates that the mongod.exe process is running successfully."
 
To connect to MongoDB through the mongo.exe shell, open another Command Prompt:
 
> "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongo.exe" (but this fails, perhaps because of db path)
 
"Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the Production Notes document."


1.2.3 Configure and Install MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
 
"Execute the ... steps from the Administrator command prompt."

"Create directories for your database and log files:"

> mkdir c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\mongodb\db
 
> mkdir c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\mongodb\log

"Create a configuration file. The file must set systemLog.path. Include additional configuration options as appropriate."
 
Ex. With Notepad, create mongod.cfg file as with this content:
 
systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\mongodb\log\mongod.log
storage:
    dbPath: c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\mongodb\db

And then save it here (Permissions wouldn't allow me to save it directly here): C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\mongod.cfg 

"Install the MongoDB service:"

> "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" --config "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\mongod.cfg" --install

Then start or stop the MongoDB service:
 
> net start MongoDB
 
> net stop MongoDB
 
It can also be configured to start automatically.
 
See also instructions to remove the service, if need be.


1.3 node-gyp

https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm
 
"If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use node-gyp for that task. For a Unix system, node-gyp needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows, Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ is needed."
 
https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
 
> npm install -g node-gyp
 
> npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
 
The latter command installs everything required, including the correct (older) version of Python. See ref link for other options.
 

1.4 Create a new folder for your project

Ex.:

> md c:\users\doug\documents\angularfullstack\dedyongfull4


###


2 INSTALLATION

https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack

2.1 Setting the Options, Scaffolding the Project, and Installing the npm Dependencies

First, install global requirements:

> npm install -g yo gulp-cli generator-angular-fullstack 

On this system (Win 10 x64) that installation yields the following warning, which apparently can be ignored:

npm WARN deprecated npmconf@2.1.2: this package has been reintegrated into npm and is now out of date with respect to npm

Then, run Yeoman AngularFullstack, which is interactive, with questions to answer, to set options (I have accepted the default options, below, unless otherwise indicated; typically, use arrow keys to move between options):

> yo angular-fullstack

? May generator-angular-fullstack anonymously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time? (Y/n) y

[graphic of Yeoman] "Welcome to Yeoman, ladies and gentlemen!"

"Out of the box I create an AngularJS app with an Express server."
 
# Client

? What would you like to write scripts with?
> Babel
  Typescript

? Would you like to use Flow type with Babel? (y/N) n

? What would you like to write markup with?
> HTML
  Pug

? What would you like to write stylesheets with?
  CSS
> Sass
  Stylus
  Less

? What Angular router would you like to use?
  ngRoute
> uiRouter

? Would you like to include Bootstrap? (Y/n) y

? Would you like to include UI Bootstrap? (Y/n) y

# Server

? What would you like to use for data modeling? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to inverse selection)
> (*) Mongoose (MongoDB)
  ( ) Sequelize (MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, PostgreSQL)

? Would you scaffold out an authentication boilerplate? (Y/n) y

? Would you like to include additional oAuth strategies? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to inverse selection)
>( ) Google
 ( ) Facebook
 ( ) Twitter

? Would you like to use socket.io? (Y/n) y

# Project

? What would you like to write tests with? (Use arrow keys)
> Jasmine [not default]
  Mocha + Chai + Sinon [default]

Then ...
 
You're using the fantastic NgComponent generator.

Initializing yo-rc.json configuration.

   create package.json
   create .babelrc
   ...

... the entire project is scaffolded. However, on my system (Win 10 x64) the following Warnings and Errors are also generated. See below, in various categories, for resolutions (if any).


2.2 Warnings and Workarounds

See also npm WARN above, about npmconf@2.1.2, which apparently can be ignored.
